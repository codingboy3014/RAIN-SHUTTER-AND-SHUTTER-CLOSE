âœ… 1. Wiring Diagram Summary
ðŸŸ¦ Rain Sensor (Digital Mode)
Rain Sensor Pin	Connect to Arduino
VCC	5V
GND	GND
D0	Pin 2

When rain is detected, D0 usually goes LOW (0).
But in your code, itâ€™s checking for HIGH â€“ so test it and change the logic if needed. Iâ€™ll explain this in section 4.

ðŸ”µ Soil Moisture Sensor (Analog)
Soil Sensor Pin	Connect to Arduino
VCC	5V
GND	GND
A0	A0

Use Serial Monitor to read actual moisture values and adjust threshold if needed.

ðŸ”´ Relay Module (to control water pump)
Relay Pin	Connect to Arduino
VCC	5V
GND	GND
IN	Pin 8

Relay (to control pump):
COM â†’ one wire of pump

NO â†’ external power +

Other pump wire â†’ external power â€“

Common GND between power source and Arduino

ðŸŸ¢ Servo Motor
Servo Wire	Connect to
Red	5V (or external 5V)
Brown/Black	GND
Yellow/Orange	Pin 9
